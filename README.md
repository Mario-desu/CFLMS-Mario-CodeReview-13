# CFLMS-Mario-CodeReview-13
Some explanation about my CR13:
if you open the index-page(home) you will see all the entries from the database. In the database you will find 2 tables (event, type). I used a foreign key to connect them. In the navbar you will find "Add Event". With that you can add the event.
On the cards you will find the required data. If you click on Details you will find all infos about the event. If you click on the edit-icon you can edit it, when clicking on the delete-icon you can delete it.
I also made the bonuspoints. I made a controller for that (Filter). The FK in the url will filter it by category. To filter it go to the dropdown in the navbar and select the category. It will only show entries from the selected category.
